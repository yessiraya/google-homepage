Today is Monday, Sept 28, 2020. 
I'm back trying to restart The Odin Project after a few months. I'm trying to learn as much as possible. I'm currently also taking an Intro to Scripting class at my university, I'm completing exercises through freecodecamp.org. I'm taking all kinds of suggestions. 
We'll see what happens.
